The mftzone, disablelastaccess, DisableCompression parameters require a server reboot. Deployment should be performed during the maintenance window.
Before implementing the disablelastaccess, disable8dot3 settings, it is necessary to test them with the backup system that is used.

The task does not say in what environment the script will be deployed. The path to apply the script and other necessary steps depend on the environment.
If it is a small environment for 2-3 servers, then there will be one set of steps and parameters that need to be monitored and taken into account.
If it is a large set of servers, then the path to apply will be different.
I do not see any errors in the script itself, but there are many nuances that depend on the environment in which it is used.
The command executed in the script does not perform any actions that can cause a spontaneous reboot of the server.
This command sets the keys in the registry, which can also be set manually or through group policy.
To apply the changes, a manual reboot of the server is required.
