The options for implementation and testing are different and depend on the company environment and services used.
In my case, the scheme of rolling out changes through DEV environment, then QA, Pre-production, and Production is used.
The change is tested in each of the environments and if the tests are successful, the change will be deploy in the next one.
It's possible to apply changes by writing DSC configurations; there are standard DSC resources for operating with registry branches, services, and files.
You can roll out changes by using GPO or Microsoft SCCM.
The implementation is controlled by running Pester tests on servers or collecting reports from servers. In the case of SCCM, it is controlled by the task executive conditions.
Checking the impact of changes by testing production systems and measuring server performance parameters before and after applying the change.
